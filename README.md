# OVIDE
Online Virtual IDE

# Synopsis

Our Online Virtual IDE [OVIDE](http://ovide.herokuapp.com/)  was made as part of our coursework so as to help a vast majority of users and clients to code in various languages at their own pace. Support for multiple languages and a robust UI makes programming possible without installing dedicated compilers and software on the client machine required to run their programs locally.
 so as to help a vast majority of users and clients to code in various languages at their own pace. Support for multiple languages and a robust UI makes programming possible without installing dedicated compilers and software on the client machine required to run their programs locally.  Dynamic auto-sync feature saves the current client's code into our servers, ensuring that the userâ€™s code is safe, even during failures.
